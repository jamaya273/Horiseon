# Code Refactor project

## Optimizing a sample website for a marketing agency

### Project purpose
The purpose of this project is to refact a codebase to be optimized search engine, this optimization will result in an improvement of quality and quantity of the website traffic. Also, it is important to follow accessibility standards when coding a webpage, because it would allow to read it in a simple way, then other developers could understand it much easier, and it will save significant time during the maintenance taks.

### Reason to standardization
On my short experience with websites design, I have realized that when I am coding and wanting to get certain features working at the website, there are multiple ways to get similar results and this could conduct to messy coding designs. It may be the case for many others when coding and we have all those many of options. It is a good idea to stick to recommendations for standardization, they could be found on specialized sites such https://www.w3schools.com/html/ created with educational purposes and has been very useful on my initial project as web developer.

### Procedure on the project
Once I reviewed the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, I proceeded to identify potential areas for improvement. According to standardization rules is recommended to use semantic HTML elements whenever possible, then I added those elements to the original HTML code. Second, I checked the CSS code where I found coding repeating multiple times, rearranged the code to make it easier to read and to be more efficient. Finally, I verified all the functionality of the website to confirm that is works as expected. 

### Changed items

- Semantic HTML elements added and rearraged: header, main, sections, aside, footer.
- Logical structure top-bottom.
- Alt text attributes for all images
- Heading elements follows sequence h1,h2,h3,h4 in css style file.
- Change title to be more descriptive.
- All links pointing to internal elements working properly.
- Rearrange classes and ids on css file. Ids used for unique elements in the website and Classes to be reused for more than one element.
- Oerflow attribut set as auto to handle better containers with images and text.
